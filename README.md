The below code anlyticsmba.r runs on a hundreds and thousands of line item in excel and displays the visualization in few seconds 

GGPlot package is the most minimalistic package to view long datasets

The package is based on several layers, which are as follows:
1.	Data: This layer represents the dataset that we want to visualize.
2.	Aesthetics: This layer maps the data onto the attributes such as the x-axis, y-axis, color, fill, size, labels, alpha, shape, line width, and line type.
3.	Geometrics: This layer displays our data using different geometries such as point, line, histogram, bar, or boxplot.
4.	Facets: This layer displays a subset of the data using columns and rows.
5.	Statistics: This layer performs operations such as binning, smoothing, descriptive, and intermediate statistics on the data.
6.	Coordinates: This layer defines the space between data and the display using Cartesian, fixed, polar, or limits.
7.	Themes: This layer allows for the customization of non-data elements of the plot.
